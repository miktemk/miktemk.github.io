I am a Toronto-based software developer, enginner, architect, deity.

I specialize in UX, problem-space, and business model analysis from an engineering point of view, in particular finding the optimal points to harness the full extent of modern computing technology and the juxtaposition of users, user interface and the machine.

I like travelling and drinking cappucinos. (Hey, that's what the old bio used to say!)

I also spent 2 years pursuing a dergree in Culinary Arts. I'd like to think being in a radically different industry helped me to see the IT industry in a different light. My friends just tell me it was an excuse for me to dick around in Italy for 2 years... :(

-CHEERS!

PS. I am proficient in Math and Turkish Music Theory and Lunar Science....
