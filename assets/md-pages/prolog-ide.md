# Prolog IDE

Prolog is a powerful AI language, potentially (if not cannibalized like in the past, lol) the language of the future. The world could use a small app to quickly whip up and test some of those hyper-logical prolog facts queries.

 - Drag and drop the prolog script file into the left-side pane
 - Use `Ctrl+SPACE` to run the query against the facts and predicates in the script
 - Use `Ctrl+S` to save the prolog script
