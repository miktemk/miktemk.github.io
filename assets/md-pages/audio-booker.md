# Audio booker

Reading audiobooks can be frustrating, especially if you skrew up often. Worry no more! Record your audiobook in small chunks with this app:

 - Use `SPACE` to commit chuncks recorded well
 - Use `BACKSPACE` to start a chunk from scratch in case you skrew up.
 - Use `R` to replay the previous chunck in case you forgot where it ended
 - Finally press the `Stop` button and it will stich all chunks together into one wav file!
