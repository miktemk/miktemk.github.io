# Avalon Edit XSHD Syntax Highlight Editor

Avalon Edit offers some powerful syntax highlighting features described rather briefly [on their documentation page](http://avalonedit.net/documentation/html/4d4ceb51-154d-43f0-b876-ad9640c5d2d8.htm). The ability to define a rich syntax colorization scheme enables you to define new, potentially ground-breaking programming languages. The trick is to be able to make changes to it quickly.

Use this application to quickly edit and preview the XSHD for your custom syntax highlighting.

 - Drag and drop the XSHD file into the left-side pane
 - Drag and drop a sample file into the right-side pane
 - Use `Ctrl+SPACE` to apply the XSHD chuncks recorded well
 - Use `Ctrl+S` to save the XSHD file drag-and-dropped onto the left side

If there are any errors in the XSHD, they will be shown upon the next `Ctrl+SPACE`
